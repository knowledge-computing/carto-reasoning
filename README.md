### Required Flags

- `--model`  
  Name of the model to run (e.g., `gemini-2.5-pro`, `llava-hf/llava-onevision-qwen2-72b-ov-hf`).  
  *By default, this is set to the largest model in each family.*

  Path to the JSON file containing the questions.  

- `--images`  
  Path to the directory containing the associated images.

### Open-Source Model–Only Flags
These flags apply only when running open-source models:  

- `--flash`  
  Enable Flash Attention for faster inference if supported.  

- `--batch_size`  
  Batch size for processing inputs.
